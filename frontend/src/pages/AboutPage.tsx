          Get to know our webapplication "Stupl" that enables every D-INFK
          Bachelor student to plan her/his studies. The DINFK Bachelor
          regulations are one above all: complicated! Loosing overview over what
          is done and what needs to be done to get you Bachlor in time happens
          very easily. To prevent that from happening "Plan your studies"
          provides a simple way to plan everything and make sure that the plan
          satisifies all requirements.

          from scratch. The Bibstreet Boys are Charles Kremer, Mark Csurgay,
          Konstantin Sturm, Leander Diaz Bone, and Yanick Schimpf.
